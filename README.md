# Project Overview

This Python script leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze, visualize, and narrate insights from a dataset. The script performs the following steps:

1 Dataset Reading: Reads the dataset with automatic encoding detection to ensure compatibility and accuracy.

2 Correlation Heatmap: Generates a heatmap to visualize relationships between numerical features in the dataset.

3 AI-Generated Insights: Queries an AI model to extract insights and provide a narrative based on the dataset summary.

4 README Generation: Produces a comprehensive README file containing the dataset summary, AI-generated insights, and visualizations.

The goal of this project is to showcase the integration of machine learning, data visualization, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze datasets and present meaningful insights.

# Features

A Dataset Analysis:

 Automatically detects file encoding for seamless data reading.

 Provides a summary of the dataset structure and contents.

B Data Visualization:

 Creates a correlation heatmap to highlight relationships among numerical features.

C AI Insights:

 Utilizes an LLM (GPT-4o-mini) to generate textual insights based on dataset summaries and trends.

D Comprehensive Report:

 Automatically generates a structured README.md file containing:

 Dataset overview

 AI-generated insights

 Heatmap visualizations

 Key findings and interpretations.
